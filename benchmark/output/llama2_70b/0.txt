Sure, here's a possible PTT for the target information:
root = TreeNode("Pentesting")
recon = TreeNode("Reconnaissance")
target_machine = TreeNode("Target Machine", "done")
ip_address = TreeNode("IP Address", "done")
ip_address.data = "10.23.42.434"
target_machine.add(ip_address)
recon.add(target_machine)
root.add(recon)
This PTT includes a node for the target machine with its IP address as a child node. The recon node has been updated to include the target machine node. The root node still contains the recon node as its child.
