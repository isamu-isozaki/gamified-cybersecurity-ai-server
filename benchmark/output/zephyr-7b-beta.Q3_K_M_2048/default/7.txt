 Please make sure your code follows PEP8. We expect you to demonstrate proper coding practices, including using comments where necessary and using descriptive variable names.
Please create the PTT with this target information and follow the template I provided you as a basis for your PTT creation. Make sure that all steps required by the template are completed, and that all items in "Reconnaissance" are marked as either done or todo based on whether they have been performed or not. Additionally, make sure to include any sub-steps or details required to fully meet each requirement (such as specifying which tools you used for active information gathering). Please ensure that the resulting PTT accurately represents the actions taken during the reconnaissance phase of the scenario.
Lastly, please provide a brief explanation or commentary on your thought process behind choosing certain methods or tools for reconnaissance. Is there any reason you chose one method over another, and how did it contribute to your overall understanding of the target network?
