 with a single active network interface, eth0. Scanning reveals that only TCP ports 80 and 443 are open on this interface, but further reconnaissance indicates that additional services may be listening on other network interfaces or non-standard ports.
During passive information gathering, the tester discovered that the machine is running Apache web server version 2.4.10, with an outdated PHP installation (5.3.29). The machine also appears to be using a custom SSH server implementation and has a weak root password.
In addition, the tester found that the organization's domain name registrar is GoDaddy.com, indicating that they may have used a web-based service for registration. This information could potentially lead to further reconnaissance opportunities.
Based on the given target information, can you add more details to the "Identify Open Ports and Services" section of the PTT? Specifically, I want to know if there are any other network interfaces or non-standard ports that may have open services running.
