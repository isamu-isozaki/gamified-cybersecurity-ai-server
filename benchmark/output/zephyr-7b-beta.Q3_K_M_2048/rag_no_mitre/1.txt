3/24, and is running Windows Server 2016 Standard Edition. The machine's hostname is SERVER-WIN16STD-01. It has a public IP of 75.126.28.128, and the organization provides DNS services for it via Microsoft Azure DNS.
Its domain name is server.example.com.
The machine's Windows Firewall is enabled, but all incoming traffic is allowed by default except for RDP (TCP/3389), which requires a password.
The machine has two network adapters. The primary adapter (NIC 1) is connected to the organization's internal network (10.23.42.0/24). The secondary adapter (NIC 2) is connected to the public internet via NAT on the organization's firewall.
The machine is running several services, including:
- Microsoft Routing Protocol (MRP) - Listening on TCP/546 and UDP/546
- Microsoft DNS Server - Listening on UDP/53
- HTTP - Listening on TCP/80
- SSL/TLS - Listening on TCP/443
- MS-RPC (DCE-RPC) - Listening on various ports between TCP/135 and 139, as well as TCP/4967 and UDP/137, 138, and 514
- Microsoft Virtual Machine Remote Control - Listening on TCP/5900
The machine does not appear to be running any other services that are commonly associated with vulnerabilities.
The organization has provided a list of authorized IP addresses for accessing the machine via RDP (TCP/3389). The list includes:
- 10.23.42.253 (the internal network's default gateway)
- 10.23.42.167 (another server in the organization's network)
- 10.23.42.183 (a client workstation in the organization's network)
The machine appears to be running an up-to-date version of Windows Server 2016 Standard Edition. The most recent cumulative update was installed on 07/05/2021. No security updates have been skipped since then.
There is no evidence of any active security threats or incidents related to this machine.
The organization has provided a list of authorized applications for remote access via RDP (TCP/3389). The list includes:
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Client version 10.0.17763.521 (Windows 10 October 2018 Update)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Client version 10.0.15063.379 (Windows Server 2019)
The organization's IT department has implemented several security measures to mitigate the risks associated with remote access via RDP (TCP/3389). These measures include:
- Requiring a strong password for RDP connections
- Limiting access to authorized IP addresses and applications
- Disabling certain RDP features, such as the ability to connect using the Remote Desktop Promotion Client
- Applying strict network security policies, such as enforcing encryption and multi-factor authentication
The machine appears to be properly patched and configured according to industry best practices. However, there is no evidence of any third-party software or applications installed on the machine that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities. The organization has a comprehensive security policy in place for all hardware and software components of its IT infrastructure. It includes regular patch management, periodic backups, strict access controls, and ongoing monitoring and testing to detect and mitigate threats proactively.
In summary, the machine appears to be secure and properly configured according to industry best practices. No evidence has been found to suggest any vulnerabilities or security weaknesses related to remote access via RDP (TCP/3389). The organization's IT department has implemented several measures to mitigate risks associated with remote access, and it appears that all hardware and software components of the machine are properly patched and configured according to industry best practices. Based on the passage above, Can you provide a summary of the network services running on the target machine, and any potential vulnerabilities or security weaknesses related to remote access via RDP?
