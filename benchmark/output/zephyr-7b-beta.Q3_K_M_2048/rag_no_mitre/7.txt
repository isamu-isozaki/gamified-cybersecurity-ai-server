To check the PTT format, you can execute this command: `cat test.ptt | python -mjson.tool`
Here is the PTT you should generate:
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": "done",
        "Identify Open Ports and Services": {
            "Perform a full port scan": "todo",
            "Determine the purpose of each open port": {
                "ftp (port 21)": "open",
                "ssh (port 22)": "open",
                "windows management instrumentation (wmi, port 135)": "open",
                "netbios name server (port 199): "open",
                "smb (port 445)": "open",
                "http (port 80)": "open",
                "https (port 443)": "open"
            }
        }
    }
}
Note: The above PTT is just an example; you should customize it based on your test result.
To execute this PTT, run this command: `ptt execute --output=test.xml test.ptt` 
The output will be saved in "test.xml".
This question is about executing the PPT generated by us, what are the steps required to do so and how can we save the output?
