Implement the TreeNode class from the UML diagram provided in the template.
TreeNode class is the base class for the tree structure. It has two attributes: name (str) and children list (list). Its constructor takes a name as an argument and sets both the attributes. In addition, it has an add method to add child nodes recursively. This method first checks whether self.children is empty; if so, add child node to self.children directly. Otherwise, iterate through each of its children, check if its type is TreeNode (i.e., has a children attribute), and then call itself with the child as argument to recursively add it.

Based on the passage above, Can you provide an implementation of the TreeNode class as described in the UML diagram?
