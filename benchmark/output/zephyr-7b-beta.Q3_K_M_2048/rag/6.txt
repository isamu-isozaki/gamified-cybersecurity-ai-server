 This allows us to test many classes at once, simply by passing them as arguments to the main() function. Each class you declare will be instantiated with a new instance of the other class passed as an argument. Based on the passage above, Can you create a Python class for performing a full port scan during the identification of open ports in pentesting? The class should be able to take another similar class as its argument and execute it within its methods. Additionally, the class should allow for the determination of the purpose of each open port after the scan is complete. Ensure that your implementation conforms with Python coding conventions and includes appropriate comments where necessary.
