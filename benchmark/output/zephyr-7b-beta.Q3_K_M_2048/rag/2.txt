Finally, let's wrap up the test by cleaning up and covering our tracks:

 - Cleanup Phase - [to-do]

Note that throughout this test, it's essential to follow best practices for social engineering and privilege escalation. Use techniques such as phishing emails, password cracking, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities to gain access and privileges where necessary. Remember to continuously assess the target network for new opportunities and adjust tactics accordingly.
