 what the output of running "telnet 10.10.11.239 3000" implies, as a penetration tester reporting to a senior colleague. Be sure to highlight any potentially suspicious behavior observed during this test.

As a penetration tester, I have executed the command "telnet 10.10.11.239 3000" and have successfully connected to the specified IP address on port 3000. The escape character is displayed as '^]'. There does not appear to be any immediately visible suspicious behavior during this test, but further investigation may be necessary to determine the purpose of the open service on port 3000.

In summary, our testing has revealed an uncommon port being used by the target system, which warrants closer inspection as part of our ongoing penetration testing engagement.
