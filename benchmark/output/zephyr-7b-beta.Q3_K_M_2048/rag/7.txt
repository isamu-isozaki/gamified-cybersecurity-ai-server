In this case, the PTT would look like this:
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": "done",
        "Identify Open Ports and Services": {
            "Perform a full port scan": "todo",
            "Determine the purpose of each open port": {
                "TCP Port 22": "ssh (Secure Shell)",
                "TCP Port 80": "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)",
                "TCP Port 443": "HTTPS (HTTP Secure)",
                "UDP Port 53": "DNS (Domain Name System)",
                "UDP Port 67": "DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)"
            }
        }
    }
}
Note: In real-life scenarios, the PTT will have many more details and steps. This is a simplified version for demonstrative purposes only.
