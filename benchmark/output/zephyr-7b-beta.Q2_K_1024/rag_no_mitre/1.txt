4, running Ubuntu 18.04 with Apache2 and OpenVPN installed, and has two open network services on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). It also appears to be actively communicating with an unknown server at IP address 10.57.69.183 over TCP port 5150.
The Apache2 web server is serving a static webpage containing only the following content: "This server is running Ubuntu 18.04 and Apache2."
The OpenVPN service requires authentication and appears to be using TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit. After connecting successfully, the tester was able to ping the machine from within the VPN tunnel. No other information relating to the web server or VPN service (such as credentials or configuration files) was obtained during this assessment, as the tester made no attempt to move beyond passive reconnaissance at this time.
The tester also discovered the following items of interest:
1. A CCTV feed is active on the machine and shows a live stream of an unknown location. The feed can be viewed by connecting to port 80/tcp (HTTP) using a web browser, and requesting the URL "http://10.23.42.43/cctv.html".
2. A log file containing detailed network activity appears to be stored on the machine and is being sent to an unknown server at IP address 192.168.1.185 over TCP port 5512. The log file can be viewed by connecting to port 443/tcp (HTTPS) using a web browser, and requesting the URL "https://10.23.42.43:5512".
3. The machine has been configured to automatically update itself via an unknown upstream source, with no apparent security controls in place to limit its vulnerability to malicious updates.
4. The machine's firewall configuration appears to be misconfigured, allowing unrestricted access to all network services from any IP address on the Internet.

Based on this information, we can see that the machine is running Ubuntu 18.04 with Apache2 and OpenVPN installed, and has two open network services on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). The machine also requires authentication to access its OpenVPN service, which appears to be using TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit. We can also see that there is a CCTV feed active on the machine, as well as detailed network activity being sent to an unknown server at IP address 192.168.1.185 over TCP port 5512. Additionally, we know that the machine automatically updates itself via an unknown upstream source and has misconfigured firewall settings that allow unrestricted access from any IP address on the Internet.
