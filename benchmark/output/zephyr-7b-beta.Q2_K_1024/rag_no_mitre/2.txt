Based on the Nmap scan, the web server running on 10.23.42.43 at port 80 is identified as Apache httpd 2.4.67 (CentOS Linux 7.9.2110 (Core)). The HTTP service on this machine is listening and open to connections. It's recommended that the vulnerability assessment step be conducted as soon as possible to determine if any critical security issues exist. Let's continue with the penetration testing phase and exploit identified vulnerabilities, while documenting all findings in the process.
