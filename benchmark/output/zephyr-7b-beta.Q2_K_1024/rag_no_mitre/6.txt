Write a Python function named `calculate_average` that accepts a list of numbers as an argument, calculates their average, and returns the result. Make sure to handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-numeric elements by returning meaningful errors. Use meaningful variable names, adhere to PEP8 style guidelines, and add docstrings for your function.
Create a C++ program that accepts a string as input from the user and checks whether it's a valid IP address or not (i.e., whether it conforms to the standard IPv4 format of four numbers separated by periods and ranging between 0 and 255). You should also validate that each number is separated by exactly one period. Your program should return true if the input is a valid IP address, and false otherwise.
Write a Scala function that takes a list as an argument and returns the length of the shortest string in it. If all elements are null or empty, the function should return 0. The function name is `shortestStringLength`. Make sure to handle cases where the list contains non-string elements by returning meaningful errors. Use meaningful variable names and adhere to Scala style guidelines.
Create a Rust program that accepts an integer from the user as input, computes its factorial recursively using the definition of factorial being n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1, and prints the result. Make sure your implementation is tail-recursive to avoid stack overflow issues for large inputs. Use meaningful variable names and follow Rust style guidelines.
Create a Ruby program that accepts a filename as input from the user, reads the contents of the file, counts the number of lines in it, and returns the result. Make sure to handle cases where the file doesn't exist or can't be read for some reason by returning meaningful errors. Use meaningful variable names and follow Ruby style guidelines.
Develop a Python function named `is_palindrome` that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not (i.e., reads the same way forward as backward). The function should return true if the input string is a palindrome, and false otherwise. Make sure to handle cases where the input string contains punctuation and whitespace by removing them before checking for palmindromeness. Use meaningful variable names and adhere to Python style guidelines.
