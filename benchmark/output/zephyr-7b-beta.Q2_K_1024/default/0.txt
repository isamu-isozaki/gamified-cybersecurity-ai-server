, and it's running Ubuntu Server version 18.04 (64bit). The SSH service is available for login as user "pentest". The password is not required. Here's a list of installed applications: nmap, wget, netcat, openssl.
Generate PTT using the template. Based on the passage above, the following steps should be included in the generated PTT:
1. Initial reconnaissance and information gathering (IP address, operating system, running services, available user accounts, password requirements)
2. Information gathering through active scanning (e.g., port scan, enumeration of open ports and services, identification of running applications)
3. Use of the identified available tools to gather more detailed information about the discovered services and applications.
In the generated PTT, please provide a recommended approach (including steps 1-3 above) for performing a pentest on the given target information using the identified available tools listed in the information gathering process, such as nmap, wget, netcat, and openssl. The PTT should include specific commands or functions to be executed during each step. Additionally, recommendations for documenting findings and reporting results are appreciated.
