 Please format your answer as a code block, like so: ``` { ... } ``` .
Here's an example of what the dictionary might look like when completed:
```
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": "done",
        "Identify Open Ports and Services": {
            "Perform a full port scan": {
                "ports.ftp.port": 21,
                "ports.ftp.service": "FTP",
            },
            "Determine the purpose of each open port": {
                "port 21": "FTP",
            }
        },
    }
```
