 and has the following open ports:
* Port 21 (FTP)
* Port 80 (HTTP)
* Port 443 (HTTPS)
* Port 5672 (SSH)
The attacker will perform a full port scan and determine the purpose of each open port. The attacker can use this information to plan their next steps in the attack.
You can then add more nodes to the tree by calling the `add` method on the `TreeNode` objects, like this:
identify_open_ports.add(TreeNode("Determine if any open ports are vulnerable to known exploits"))
identify_open_ports.add(TreeNode("If so, attempt to exploit them"))
 root.add(identify_open_ports)
This will create a tree with the nodes representing the different steps in the attack and their dependencies. You can then use this tree to represent the attack
