    - Enumerate Users - (to-do)
        - Leverage tools such as CrackMapExec, Impacket's smbclient, or BloodHound - (to-do)
        - Utilize password spraying - (to-do)

Note: The specific techniques and tools used for each step may vary depending on the target environment. Adjust the todo list as needed to fit your situation.

To perform a full port scan, you can use the following command in Kali Linux:

nmap - p- TCP, UDP, SCTP - O - Pn - v - sS 10.23.42.43

This will scan all open ports (TCP, UDP, and SCTP) without any filtering (-p-), using the traceroute feature (-O), showing only basic output (-o), displaying ping scanning (-Pn), verbose (-v), and setting the starting point to SYN (-sS).

After running this command, you should see a list of open ports along with their corresponding services. Use tools like Nmap's service version detection (-sV) or ncat to further investigate these services.

To enumerate users, use CrackMapExec to perform a password spray attack. Here is an example usage:

crackmapexec smb 10.23.42.43 -u admin -p "password!" --users

This will connect to the SMB service on 10.23.42.43, use the username 'admin', and attempt a password spray attack using the password 'password!' while also listing all users on the system.

Other tools for user enumeration include Impacket's smbclient or BloodHound to graphically display relationships between users.

Remember to always follow responsible disclosure practices when performing these actions, and be sure to obtain proper authorization before proceeding with exploitation.
