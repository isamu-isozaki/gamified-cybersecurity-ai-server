Now, based on this information, please generate a PTT that covers all the necessary steps for each phase of the attack. Remember to not perform any post-exploitation steps or actions in the simulation environment as it is only certified and simulated. Your PTT should be detailed and accurately reflect the sequence of events required to successfully complete each stage of the attack.
