 and has a valid SSL certificate. The machine is running an Apache web server on port 80 and a MySQL database server on port 3306. There are two network printers connected to the machine, one HP LaserJet and one Xerox Phaser 6120dn. The printer at location A contains sensitive information about employee salaries.
Generate the following output:
Pentesting (root node)
- Reconnaissance (recon node)
    | Passive Information Gathering (passive_info_gathering node)
    | Active Information Gathering (active_info_gathering node)
    | Identify Open Ports and Services (identify_open_ports node)
      | Perform a full port scan (TreeNode with children not shown)
      | Determine the purpose of each open port (TreeNode with children not shown)

We can see that we are able to drill down into specific areas of the target system and gather more detailed information. By creating a tree-like data structure, we can better organize our findings and maintain a clear understanding of the overall picture. Additionally, by including completed tasks as child nodes to their respective parent nodes, we can easily track progress and identify any outstanding issues that require attention. Finally, by generating the output in this format, we can more easily communicate our findings to other members of the pentesting team or to clients if necessary.
