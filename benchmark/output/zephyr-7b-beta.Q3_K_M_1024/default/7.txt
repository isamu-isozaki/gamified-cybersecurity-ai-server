The target machine has a web server running on port 80. It is also hosting a mysql database that is exposed to the public internet. You should include information about the application and server as well as any known vulnerabilities. You may assume the following:
* The OS is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu) OpenSSL/1.0.2g PHP/7.0.33-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 Configuration: Server/4.1.12
* The web application is running version 1.5.2 of myapp and uses PHP as its scripting language
No known vulnerabilities have been discovered yet
No other software or services are present on this system
The database server is MySQL Community Server - GPL Version 5.7.24-0ubuntu0.16.04.1. The web application connects to the database using a simple username/password mechanism, with the credentials admin:admin123. The password for this account is also used by the MySQL root user, which has not been changed since installation.
The scan results indicate that the machine is running several other services besides Apache and MySQL, but these do not appear to be related to the web application or database server. These include:
- SSH (PuTTY) - version 2.0
- Snmp (SNMPv2-server) - community name "public"
- DNS (Name Daemon) - recursive mode enabled
Generate your PTT based on the target information provided, following the format and structure specified in the instructions provided. Ensure that your PTT accurately reflects the target information and provides detailed, actionable intelligence for further post-exploitation steps if necessary. Your PTT should be written in clear and concise language, using standardized naming conventions and formatting to ensure consistency and ease of use. Remember to include relevant details such as IP addresses, port numbers, software versions, usernames, passwords, and any other pertinent information that can help you execute your attack. Finally, be sure to test your PTT thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability, and always adhere to industry-standard security best practices when generating PTTs or executing post-exploitation steps.
