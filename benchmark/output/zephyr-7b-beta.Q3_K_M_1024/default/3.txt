 the Nmap scan results for the IP address 10.10.11.239, highlighting any interesting findings based on the given text material.\n
Nmap scan reveals three open ports: SSH (22/tcp), HTTP (80/tcp), and PPP (3000/tcp) on the IP address 10.10.11.239. Noteworthy is the presence of PPP, which may point to a dial-up connection or potentially an outdated protocol in use. Further investigation into the nature of this service should be conducted as it poses potential security risks.\n
In summary, we have identified three services running on 10.10.11.239, with SSH and HTTP being common, but PPP is unusual and requires further analysis to determine its specific usage or configuration.
