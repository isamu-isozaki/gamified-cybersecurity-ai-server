This is a good start for this engagement, but since it's only the first day, you're only in the reconnaissance stage. Please continue with the next steps and generate an update on progress. However, I request that you limit the use of automated tools during this phase to avoid raising any alarms and also do not try any exploits at this point. Instead, focus on gathering as much information about the organization's assets, applications, network layout, and security posture as possible.

At the end of day 2, please generate an update with a detailed report of all the information gathered during reconnaissance, initial access, privilege escalation, credential access, and any other relevant activities performed during this time frame. Also, provide recommendations for further actions based on your findings. Remember to follow standard security practices and avoid conducting any attacks or exploiting any vulnerabilities at this point.

Based on the provided information, I recommend performing the following tasks during day 2:

- Continue with reconnaissance by performing a full port scan using Nmap or another similar tool to identify all open ports and services running on the target machine. Once done, determine the purpose of each service by correlating it with relevant information obtained from active information gathering and passive information gathering.
- Perform a vulnerability assessment using a vulnerability scanner like Qualys or Open VAS. This should help in identifying any known CVEs as well as missing patches that could potentially be exploited later on during the engagement.
- Enumerate all local and domain users on the target network, including their roles, privileges, and access level. Utilize a tool like BloodHound or PowerView to perform this task.
- Create a network map of the target organization to have an understanding of the overall layout, including firewall configurations, servers, and endpoints.

For day 3, I recommend:

- Use a dictionary attack tool like Hydra or Ncrack to perform credential guessing on all identified accounts and assess whether any weak credentials are being used.
- Utilize PowerShell or similar scripts for privilege escalation, including utilizing tools such as Mimikatz, PsExec, BloodHound, or PowerView to gain higher privileges and access to service account credentials. 
- Use Covenant or another similar tool to perform lateral movement across the organization's network.

However, I request that any potential exploits be performed during this stage only in a sandbox environment to avoid triggering any alarms and raising suspicions.

At the end of day 3, please provide an update on progress and detail all relevant actions taken during reconnaissance, initial access, privilege escalation, credential access, and any other activities performed during this time frame. Also, provide recommendations for further actions based on your findings. Remember to follow standard security practices and avoid conducting any attacks or exploiting any vulnerabilities at this point.

Note: The target organization is a financial institution with several critical systems in use, including Microsoft Windows Server 2019, Exchange Server 2016, Oracle Database 18c, and SQL Server 2016 Standard Edition SP2. The organization has also implemented several security measures, including a robust access control mechanism, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and encrypted communication using SSL/TLS. There are no apparent weak points or vulnerabilities that can be exploited during this stage. However, it's advisable to approach this engagement with great caution and follow all standard security practices to avoid raising any alarms.
