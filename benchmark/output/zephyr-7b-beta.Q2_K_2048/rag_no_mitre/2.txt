Next, the tester will begin by performing a full port scan using Nmap. The following output is produced:

Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-05-08 09:46 PDT
Nmap 7.01 -scan 10/23/42.43 

This initial scan reveals that the machine has multiple open ports, including those for FTP (21), SSH (22), and RDP (3389). The tester will now identify the purpose of each open port using Nmap's service and version detection capabilities:

Nmap scan report for 10.23.42.43 (Host 10.23.42.43)

PORT STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open http
111/tcp open rpcbind
135/tcp closed msrcp
139/tcp open ms-wbt-server
443/tcp open https
3389/tcp open ms-rmdesktop
21/tcp open ftp
22/tcp open ssh
445/tcp open ms-wbt-server

Based on the results, it seems that the machine is running Windows Server 2008 R2 based on Nmap's identification of Microsoft services such as MS-WBT-Server and MS-RDCDESKTOP. The tester will now move forward with vulnerability assessment and network mapping using nmap and other tools.
