Below is the valid PTT:
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": "done",
        "Identify Open Ports and Services": {
            "Perform a full port scan": {
                "Fingerprint the OS": "nmap-os-spoofer.pl - ping - n - T3:T0 -- open -- os -- version -- script -- timing 10.23.42.434",
                "Scan for TCP services": "nmap -p1-65535 -Pn -n - Aggressive 10.23.42.434",
                "Scan for UDP services": "nmap -sU -Pn -n 10.23.42.434",
                "Nmap results": ""
            },
            "Determine the purpose of each open port": "todo"
        }
    }
}
This is the full command to run, in Linux or macOS:
python -c 'import pprint; print(pp.pformat({...}))' - replacing the three dots (...) with your PTT.
To execute this, follow these steps:
1. Copy the PTT template provided above into a text editor.
2. Customize it based on your scan results and target information.
3. Save it as a .py file.
4. Run python -c 'import pprint; print(pp.pformat({...}))' where {...} is replaced with the PTT you created in step 2.
5. The Python dictionary will be printed to the console.
