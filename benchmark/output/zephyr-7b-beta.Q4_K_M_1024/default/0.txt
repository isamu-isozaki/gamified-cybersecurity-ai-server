, and it runs on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus). All ports are closed by default, except for port 80 (HTTP), which is configured to redirect all requests to https://www.example.com/. The web application running on this server can be accessed via the HTTPS protocol at https://10.23.42.434/example_app/. The server also has a hostname of example-server, which is registered within DNS.
The organization's domain name is example.com, and its mail server is located at mail.example.com (SMTP). The organization allows users to connect via IMAP using two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled by default. The organization requires the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption when accessing email.
The network is segmented into multiple subnets, with different services running on each subnet. The IP address ranges for these subnets are: 10.23.42.0/24, 10.23.43.0/24, and 192.168.1.0/24. Access control is enforced using network-level firewalls, which allow only authorized traffic to pass through. The organization also utilizes Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology for remote access.
The organization uses a centralized authentication server (LDAP) to manage user credentials and access to resources. All employees are required to change their passwords every 90 days and cannot reuse old passwords. Strong password policies are enforced, with requirements for lengths, complexity, and use of special characters.
Employees are encouraged to report any suspicious activity or security incidents to the organization's Security Operations Center (SOC), which is staffed 24/7. The SOC uses a combination of automated tools and human expertise to monitor network traffic and respond to threats in real-time.
The organization has implemented endpoint protection software on all devices, including servers, workstations, laptops, and mobile devices. These solutions include antivirus, anti-malware, and intrusion detection/prevention capabilities. Regular updates and patches are applied to all software and operating systems to ensure security and compliance with industry standards.
The organization maintains a detailed inventory of all assets, including hardware, software, and network configurations. This information is regularly reviewed to identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.
Backups are taken on a regular basis, with both onsite and offsite storage options available. Data encryption is used for all sensitive information, and access controls ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify this data.
The organization has implemented a formal incident response plan, which outlines steps to be followed in the event of a security breach or other critical event. This plan includes communication protocols, escalation procedures, and recovery strategies. Regular training is provided to all employees on their roles and responsibilities during an incident.
