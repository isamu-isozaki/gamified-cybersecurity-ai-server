 Only provide the object instantiation and relevant attributes initialization. We will run this PTT as part of our automation framework during the pentesting engagement and expect to see the final results printed out to a log file or displayed on a console for us to verify.
I hope you can help me with this task. Please let me know if you need any further information or clarifications. I will be waiting for your response as soon as possible.
What is the IP address of the target machine as provided in the given text material?
Your Python code should contain an object instantiation and initialization of relevant attributes based on the target information provided to generate a TreeNode object hierarchy that accurately represents the reconnaissance phase of a pentesting engagement, including sub-nodes for passive information gathering, active information gathering, identifying open ports and services, as well as any necessary attribute values such as completion status. Finally, your Python code should add this newly created TreeNode object to the root node of an existing tree structure that represents the entire pentesting engagement. Your PTT code should be concise, readable, and follow best practices for Python style and syntax.
