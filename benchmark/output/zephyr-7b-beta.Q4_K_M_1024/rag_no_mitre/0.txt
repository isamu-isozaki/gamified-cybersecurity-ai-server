. It has two network interfaces, eth0 and eth1. Eth0 uses IP address 10.23.42.43 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0. Eth1 has an IP address of 192.168.1.100 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
Your script should output something like:
Pentesting
   Reconnaissance
      Passive Information Gathering (done)
      Active Information Gathering (done)
         Perform a full port scan
         Determine the purpose of each open port
   Identify Open Ports and Services

I have created a Python script that generates this output based on the TreeNode class and its methods. Here's how you can use it:

```python
# To print the entire tree in order
root.traverse_preorder()
print()

# To print all leaf nodes (nodes with no children)
for node in root.get_leaf_nodes():
    print(node)

# To search for a specific node and print it
search_result = root.search("Determine the purpose of each open port")
if search_result:
    print(search_result.data)
```

The `traverse_preorder()` method is called to print the entire tree in pre-order traversal, which means visiting the node first and then its children if it has any. The `get_leaf_nodes()` method returns all leaf nodes (nodes with no children) recursively. This can be useful for tasks like generating a report of only the completed tasks. Finally, you can search for a specific node by using the `search()` method.

Note that since this is just an example, there's room for improvement in terms of error handling and making it more user-friendly. But it should give you an idea of how the TreeNode class and its methods could be implemented to create a tree structure in Python.
