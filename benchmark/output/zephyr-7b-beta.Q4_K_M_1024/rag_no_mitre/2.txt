Here is a sample script to perform passive information gathering:

```python
import socket
from datetime import timedelta
from time import sleep

# Define target IP address and subnet mask
target_ip = "10.23.42.43"
subnet_mask = "255.255.255.0"

# Set up variables for storing results
domain_names = []
email_addresses = []
organization_names = []
device_names = []
os_versions = []
service_banners = {}

# Define function to extract information from banner response
def extract_information(response):
    global domain_names, email_addresses, organization_names, device_names, os_versions, service_banners
    
    # Extract domain names
    domain_names.extend(re.findall("([\w\-]+\.)[\w]{2,4}$", response))
    
    # Extract email addresses
    email_addresses.extend(re.findall("[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}", response))
    
    # Extract organization names
    organization_names.extend(re.findall("Organization: (.*?)\n", response))
    
    # Extract device names

    os_versions.extend(re.
