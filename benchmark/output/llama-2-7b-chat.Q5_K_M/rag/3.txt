 the interesting information found in this nmap scan and provide any additional context you think is relevant for a senior penetration tester to understand:\n\
Interesting information from the Nmap scan includes open ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 3000 (PPP), indicating that the device at IP address 10.10.11.239 is running SSH, a web server, and possibly a PPP connection. The "clock skew" value of -1s suggests that the device's clock may be adjusted, which could indicate potential issues with time synchronization or other security concerns.
