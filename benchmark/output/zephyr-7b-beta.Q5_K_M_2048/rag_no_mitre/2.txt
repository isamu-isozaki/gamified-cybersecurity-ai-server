The following tasks have been completed:
 - Passive Information Gathering
   - Utilized various online resources to gather all available public information about the target organization.
 - Identify Operating System and Version
   - Performed a banner grab against the web server to determine the operating system and version.

The following tasks are still pending:
 - Active Information Gathering
   - Will use Nmap to conduct a full port scan of the target machine.
   - Once completed, will compare the results with previously identified open ports to determine any changes.
 - Identify Open Ports and Services
   - Will utilize Nmap to identify all open ports and services on the target machine.
   - Will then determine the purpose of each open port by consulting relevant documentation and online resources.
 - Enumerate Users and Privileges
   - Will use various methods, such as cracking password hashes, to identify usernames on the target machine.
   - Will also attempt to determine user privileges by analyzing system logs and access control lists.
 - Identify Network Architecture and Critical Systems
   - Will map out the network topology using network discovery tools, such as Nmap or Fping.
   - Will then identify critical systems and their functions, as well as communication paths between them.
 - Research Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits
   - Will review CVEs for the identified operating system and version to determine any known vulnerabilities.
   - Will also research common software vulnerabilities and known exploits related to the target organization's applications.
