Please write your PTT following this format:

```python
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": "done",
        "Identify Open Ports and Services": {
            "Perform a full port scan": "todo",
            "Determine the purpose of each open port": {
                "21 (FTP)": "data transfer protocol",
                "22 (SSH)": "remote login protocol",
                "445 (MS-RPC)": "Microsoft's remote procedure call protocol",
                "80 (HTTP)": "Hypertext Transfer Protocol",
                "443 (HTTPS)": "encrypted HTTP traffic"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is the example PTT that we're expecting from you.
Feel free to modify it to match your own findings during the test.
Note: Please don't execute this sample PTT, as it won't work without being loaded into a testing framework (like MobSF).
Your response should be based on the following:
Perform a full port scan using nmap or similar tool with the following options: -v (increase verbosity) -p (specify specific ports to scan, e.g., 21, 22, 445, 80, 443) -b (specify an IP range/network to scan).
Next, determine the purpose of each open port by researching online or consulting network documentation.
In your PTT, provide a summary of your findings regarding open ports and services on the target machine. Your response should be in JSON format.
