You can assume any missing pieces of information or skip any steps that are not relevant to the target.
However, you should still include those sections with the "done" or "todo" status in your template.
The dictionary that follows is what I have created based on the provided target information.
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": "done",
        "Identify Open Ports and Services": {
            "Perform a full port scan": "todo",
            "Determine the purpose of each open port": "todo",
        },
    },
    "Vulnerability Scanning": {
        "Automated Tools": "done",
        "Manual Testing": "todo",
    },
}
To add to this, I'm going to assume that the machine is running a web server on port 80 and an SSH server on port 22.
Then my dictionary would look like this:
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": "done",
        "Identify Open Ports and Services": {
            "Perform a full port scan": "todo",
            "Determine the purpose of each open port": {
                "Port 22": "SSH server",
                "Port 80": "Web server",
            },
        },
    },
    "Vulnerability Scanning": {
        "Automated Tools": "done",
        "Manual Testing": "todo",
    },
}
In this example, I've nested the "Determine the purpose of each open port" section within "Identify Open Ports and Services".
This allows me to store additional information about specific ports. 
The above dictionary is great, but can you provide more details on how to perform the full port scan in "Perform a full port scan"? How do we determine which ports are open and what services are running on them? Are there any tools or techniques we should use for this step?
