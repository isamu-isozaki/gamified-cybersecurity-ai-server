Based on the text provided, generate the following steps for the "Identify Open Ports and Services" section:
   1.3 Determine the purpose of each open port - (to-do)
       1.3.1 Perform a full port scan - (to-do)
            a) Use Nmap to scan the machine's IP address and save the output to a file for analysis later.
            b) Run the command: nmap -p 1-65535 10.23.42.434 > ports.txt
       1.3.2 Determine the purpose of each open port - (to-do)
            a) Review the Nmap output and identify which ports are being used for specific services.
            b) Use the nmap service information (-sv flag) to determine the software versions running on those ports.
            c) Cross-reference the service information with known vulnerabilities and exploits to assess potential security risks.


Generate the following steps for the PTT based on the given text:
1. Reconnaissance - [to-do]
   1.1 Passive Information Gathering - (completed)
        a) Use search engines, social media platforms, and open source intelligence tools to gather information about the target organization's history, employees, products, and services.
        b) Save all relevant findings in a document or spreadsheet for future reference.
   1.2 Active Information Gathering - (completed)
        a) Use network scanning tools such as Nmap or Fping to identify open ports and running services on the target machine's IP address.
        b) Save all relevant findings in a document or spreadsheet for future reference.
   1.3 Identify Open Ports and Services - (to-do)
        a) Review the passive information gathering results to assess which services are likely to be running on the target machine based on previous incidents, industry trends, or other publicly available data.
        b) Use Nmap to perform a full port scan of the target machine's IP address and save the output to a file for analysis later.
            i. Run the command: nmap -p 1-65535 10.23.42.434 > ports.txt
        c) Use Nmap's service information (-sv flag) to determine which software versions are running on each open port identified during the full port scan.
        d) Cross-reference the identified software versions with known vulnerabilities and exploits to assess potential security risks.
