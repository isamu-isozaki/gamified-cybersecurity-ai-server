 You can assume that the root TreeNode object is already initialized, do not initialize it again. The generated code should have functions "run_recon()", "run_identify_open_ports()" and "run_all()".
The "run_recon()" function should call the "run_passive_info_gathering()", "run_active_info_gathering()" and "run_identify_open_ports()" functions recursively. The "run_all()" function should call all functions in the tree rooted at "root".
The "run_recon()", "run_identify_open_ports()" and "run_all()" functions should print out the status of the current node and call the relevant functions recursively for its children. If a child node has an unfinished status, it should not be called.
You may assume that all target information is correctly provided to the nodes, so you do not need to parse them again.
The following example implementation demonstrates how to achieve the requirements:
root = TreeNode("Pentesting")
recon = TreeNode("Reconnaissance", "done")
passive_info_gathering = TreeNode("Passive Information Gathering", "done")
active_info_gathering = TreeNode("Active Information Gathering", "done")
identify_open_ports = TreeNode("Identify Open Ports and Services")
identify_open_ports.add(TreeNode("Perform a full port scan"))
identify_open_ports.add(TreeNode("Determine the purpose of each open port", completion_status="todo"))
recon.add(passive_info_gathering)
recon.add(active_info_gathering)
recon.add(identify_open_ports)
root.add(recon)

def run_node(node):
    print(f"Running {node.data} ({node.completion_status})...")
    for child in node.children:
        # Call the child only if it is finished
        if child.completion_status == "done":
            run_node(child)
    # Call the current function recursively for this node itself
    # This prints out the status of this node and its children
    run_node(node)

def run_recon():
    return run_node(root.children[0])

def run_identify_open_ports():
    return run_node(root.children[0].children[-1])

def run_all():
    # Call all functions recursively for the root node and its children
    # This prints out the status of all nodes
    return run_node(root)

# Example usage:
run_recon()   # Output: Running Reconnaissance (done)...
run_identify_open_ports()  # Output: Running Identify Open Port
