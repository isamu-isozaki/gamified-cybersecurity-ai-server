Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
target     prot opt source               destination          state

In terms of open ports, the results are as follows:

```
TCP        0  8192   10.23.42.43   any           ESTABLISHED
TCP        0     60   10.23.42.43   75.126.195.182  SYN_SENT
TCP        0  22             *:*           LISTEN
TCP        0  80             *:*           LISTEN
TCP        0  443            *:*           LISTEN
```

The Apache web server is running on port 80 and the HTTPS service is listening on port 443
