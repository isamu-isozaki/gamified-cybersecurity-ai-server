You are now conducting Active Information Gathering, which involves sending packets to the target. Let's perform scanning on all ports by generating the following PTT:
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": {
            "Port Scan": {
                "Scan all TCP Ports (1-65535)": {
                    "Use Nmap to scan all TCP ports": "todo"
                }
            },
            "Banner Grabbing": {
                "Retrieve the service and version banners for each open port": "done"
            }
        }
    }
}
Let's add some PTTs based on your response.
{
    "Reconnaissance": {
        "Passive Information Gathering": "done",
        "Active Information Gathering": {
            "Port Scan": {
                "Scan all TCP Ports (1-65535)": {
                    "Use Nmap to scan for open ports (-p-):": "done",
                    "Use Nmap to determine the version of each service running on open ports (-sV):": "todo"
                }
            },
            "Banner Grabbing": {
                "Retrieve the service and version banners for each open port": {
                    "Use Ncat to retrieve banners from each open port (ncat -v -z -w10 <IP> <Port>):": "todo"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Feel free to modify it as per your requirements.
