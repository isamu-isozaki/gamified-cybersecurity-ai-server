Based on the information provided by the tester, it seems that we should focus our reconnaissance efforts on gathering more detailed information about Drupal version 7.64 and identifying any vulnerabilities or known issues related to this specific version. Additionally, we should look for any potential misconfigurations in SSH access control, such as open root login or weak authentication methods. Lastly, it may be worth examining the system's software update history to determine if any critical patches were missed during routine maintenance.
