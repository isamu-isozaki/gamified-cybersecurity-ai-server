 the results of running Nmap on IP address 10.10.11.239, highlighting any interesting points that may require further investigation.\n
[Penetration Tester]
During our security testing, we discovered an open SSH port (22/tcp) and two web services; HTTP (80/tcp) and PPP (3000/tcp). The PPP protocol is commonly used for dial-up connections, but it's unusual to find it open on a production network. As such, we recommend further investigation into the purpose of this service, as well as any potential security risks associated with leaving it exposed. Additionally, we noted that there are 997 closed ports that were not scanned due to the default Nmap options used in our initial scan. We suggest running a more comprehensive scan to gather additional information about these closed ports and the overall network configuration.
