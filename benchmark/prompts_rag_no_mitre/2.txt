Given Context: [CLS] ftp bounce attack - scanftp bounce - scanningmanual1. connect to vulnerable ftp2. use * * port * * or eprt ( but only 1 of them ) to make it establish a connection with the < ip : port > you want to scan : port 172, 32, 80, 80, 0, 8080 eprt | 2 | 172. 32. 80. 80 | 8080 | 3. use list ( this will just send to the connected < ip : port > the list of current files in the ftp folder ) and check for the possible responses : 150 file status okay ( this means the port is open ) or 425 no connection established ( this means the port is closed ) 1. instead of list you could also use retr / file / in / ftp and look for similar open / close responses. example using port ( port 8080 of 172. 32. 80. 80 is open and port 7777 is closed ) : same example using eprt ( authentication omitted in the image ) : open port using eprt instead of list ( different env ) nmapnmap - b < name > : < pass > @ < ftp _ server > < victim > nmap - pn - v - p 21, 80 - b ftp : [ email protected ] 127. 0. 0. 1 # scan ports 21, 80 of the ftpnmap - v - p 21, 22, 445, 80, 443 - b ftp : [ email protected ] 192. 168. 0. 1 / 24 # scan the internal network ( of the ftp ) ports 21, 22, 445, 80, 443network services pentesting - [SEP]
