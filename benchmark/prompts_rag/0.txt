 Answer 
The target information is listed below. Please follow the instruction and generate PTT. The PTT is constructed using
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data, completion_status="todo"):
        self.data = data
        assert completion_status in ["todo", "inprogress", "done"]
        self.completion_status = completion_status
        self.children = []
    def add(self, child):
        self.children.append(child)
Note that this test is certified and in simulation environment, so do not generate post-exploitation and other steps.
You may start with this template:
root = TreeNode("Pentesting")
recon = TreeNode("Reconnaissance")
passive_info_gathering = TreeNode("Passive Information Gathering", "done")
active_info_gathering = TreeNode("Active Information Gathering", "done")
identify_open_ports = TreeNode("Identify Open Ports and Services")
identify_open_ports.add(TreeNode("Perform a full port scan"))
identify_open_ports.add(TreeNode("Determine the purpose of each open port"))
recon.add(passive_info_gathering)
recon.add(active_info_gathering)
recon.add(identify_open_ports)
root.add(recon)
The below is the target information:
